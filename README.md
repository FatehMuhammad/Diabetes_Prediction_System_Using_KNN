# Diabetes_Prediction_Syatem_Using_KNN
We have a dataset having some health attributes of a patients along with the information that whether the patient has diabetes or not. Find the provided csv file named “diabetes.csv”. Try to implement K nearest neighbors algorithm and predict that if a patient have Diabetes or not. It's a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.
